## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
movies<-read.csv("movie_plots_with_genres.csv")
library(dplyr)
library(janeaustenr)
library(tidytext)
library(topicmodels)
library(tidyr)
library(factoextra)
data("stop_words")
movie_words <- movies |> unnest_tokens(word, Plot)
movie_counts <- movie_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(Movie.Name, word, sort = TRUE)
```

Weeding out the names, reorganize the data:
```{r}
library(lexicon)
data("freq_first_names")
firstname <- tolower(freq_first_names$Name)
movie_counts <- movie_counts |> filter(!(word %in% firstname))
```

Casting the words counts to a matrix
```{r}
counts_matrix<-movie_counts |> cast_dtm(Movie.Name,word,n)
```



```{r}
example <- head(counts_matrix, n=6)
print(example)
dim(movie_counts)
dim(movies)
lda <- LDA(counts_matrix, k = 30, control = list(seed = 1066))
plots_gamma <- tidy(lda, matrix = "gamma") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = topic, values_from = gamma) %>%
  drop_na()
cluster <- kmeans(select(plots_gamma, -document), centers = 8, nstart = 25)
fviz_cluster(cluster, data = select(plots_gamma, -document), geom = "point")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
